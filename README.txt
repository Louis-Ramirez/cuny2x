Project II



The Genius Bar is a technical-support station located inside Apple retail stores to provide concierge-style support for customers of Apple products. Customers who experience problems with their Apple products may enter an Apple retail store and seek assistance. They are greeted by an employee who takes their information and either assigns them to a technician for help or gives them an wait time. Technicians or "Geniuses" float in the Genius Bar area assisting customers and troubleshooting. When a Genius is finished with a customer, he/she can move on to help another.
