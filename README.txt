Project III

This Project implements a Set data structure to create a music playlist.

A set is an abstract data type that can store unique values, without any particular order. It is a computer implementation of the mathematical concept of a finite set. Set differs from Bag only in the fact that it does not allow duplicates.

I. All parts of the program were completed.


II. No bugs encountered. 


III. Instructions for compiling:

g++ -o nameofexecutablefile PlayList.cpp Song.cpp Main.cpp

VI. No input/output files.
